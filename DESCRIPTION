Description: A system for estimating size dimorphism based on metric data using
    multiple published estimation techniques for univariate data and incomplete
    multivariate data, storing information related to the calculation of those 
    estimates, and performing resampling-based significance tests for pairwise 
    comparison of dimorphism estimates.
