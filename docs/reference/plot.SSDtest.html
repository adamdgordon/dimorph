    <h2 id="arguments">Arguments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arguments"></a></h2>


<dl><dt id="arg-x">x<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-x"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An <code>SSDtest</code> object.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-est">est<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-est"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An integer specifiying the specific combination of methods (e.g., univariate
method, centering algorithm) for the resampled estimates to be plotted.  This integer corresponds to
the row number in the table providing mean or median estimates by method combination when printing
the <code>SSDtest</code> object.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-type">type<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-type"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character string specifying the type of plot to produce. <code>"est"</code> generates a plot
of histograms of estimates for all of the samples in <code>x</code>. <code>"diff"</code> gereates a plot of one
or more histograms of all possible pairwise differences in estimates between pairs of samples, with
the argument <code>diffs</code> specifying which pairs to plot.  Defaults to <code>"est"</code>.  Also, because
the plotting function calculates histograms
for <code>type="diff"</code> by first calculating the difference between all possible pairs of one estimate taken
from the two distributions of resampled values to be compared, plots using <code>type="diff"</code> can take a
long time to be generated.  The output of <code>plot.SSDtest()</code> can be saved and plotted later without the need
for recalculation.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-diffs">diffs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-diffs"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies which set of samples to plot pairwise differences for if <code>type</code> is <code>"diff"</code>. If set
to <code>"all"</code> it generates a single plot with all possible pairs.  If given a vector of two or more integers,
it plots all of the differences for that set of samples (e.g., setting <code>diffs</code> to <code>c(1,3,4)</code> will plot
three histograms: one for the differences in estimates between the first and third sample in <code>x</code>, one for the
differences between the first and fourth sample, and one for the differences between the third and fourth sample).
Any of the samples identified in <code>diffs</code> that do not include data for the estimate specified in <code>est</code>
will not be included in pairwise comparisons (e.g., if <code>"SSD"</code> was included as a univariate method on a set
of samples for which some had sex data and others didn't, the samples without sex data would be missing estimates
for that method and thus would be excluded from pairwise comparisons of <code>"SSD"</code> estimates.) An error will
be generated in cases where fewer then two samples with estimates are specified.  Defaults to "all".</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-nbins">nbins<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-nbins"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An integer specifiying the number of bins to sort data into for histograms.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-plottitle">plottitle<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-plottitle"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character string specifying a title to print at the top of the plot.  If <code>NULL</code>, no
title is printed.  Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-groupcols">groupcols<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-groupcols"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A vector of hexidecimal colors of length equal to the number of samples in <code>x</code> for use
in plots when <code>type</code> is <code>"est"</code>.  Defaults to a palette generated by <code><a href="https://kwstat.github.io/pals/reference/continuous.html" class="external-link">parula</a></code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-leg">leg<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-leg"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A logical scalar indicating whether a legend should be provided.  Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-legpos">legpos<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-legpos"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character string specifying where to plot the legend.  Acceptable values are <code>"left"</code>,
<code>"top"</code>, <code>"right"</code>, and <code>"bottom"</code>.  Defaults to <code>"right"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-legsize">legsize<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-legsize"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A numeric scalar specifying a multiplier for the legend font size relative to the default font size.
Defaults to <code>1</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-legtitle">legtitle<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-legtitle"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character string specifying a title to print at the top of the legend.  If <code>NULL</code>, no
title is printed.  Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-lty">lty<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-lty"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Line type for plotting observed fossil value in scenario where a single point estimate is calculated
for a single fossil sample.  Defaults to <code>"dashed"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-titlesize">titlesize<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-titlesize"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A numeric scalar specifying a multiplier for the title font size relative to the default font size.
Defaults to <code>2</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-invert">invert<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-invert"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An integer vector specifying the group number of histograms to invert and project below the zero
count line, where group number is determined by the order of datasets provided first in <code>fossil</code>, then in
<code>comp</code>.  If <code>NULL</code>, no histograms are inverted.  Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-xlim">xlim<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-xlim"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A numeric vector with two elements specifying the minimum and maximum values of the x-axis.  If
<code>xlim</code> is <code>NULL</code>, default values generated by <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html" class="external-link">ggplot</a></code> are used.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-ylim">ylim<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-ylim"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A numeric vector with two elements specifying the minimum and maximum values of the y-axis.  If
<code>ylim</code> is <code>NULL</code>, default values generated by <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html" class="external-link">ggplot</a></code> are used.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-diffcol">diffcol<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-diffcol"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A color used to fill in histogram bars for differences in parameter values between two samples.
defaults to <code>"#CCB03D"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-gridplot">gridplot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-gridplot"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A logical scalar indicating whether the multiple plots generated by <code>type="diff"</code> should
be plotted as a single grid of plots or not.  If <code>FALSE</code> then individual plots are printed sequentially.
Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-useradvance">useradvance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-useradvance"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A logical scalar indicating whether to prompt the user between plots when multiple plots
are generated by <code>type="diff"</code> and <code>gridplot</code> is <code>FALSE</code>. If <code>FALSE</code> then the function
waits two seconds between plots. Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg--">...<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg--"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Arguments to be passed to other functions.  Not currently used.</p></dd>
