First, let’s pull data single species, western gorillas, apelimbart data object.

Dimorphism always returned ratio values original (unlogged) units rather logarithm ratio, even calculated using logged data (effectively happens using geometric means raw data, default behavior function dimorph()). function summary() provides detailed information, including number variables (always 1 univariate analyses), number specimens included analysis (excludes specimens missing data univariate analyses), proportion females sample sex information included, mean function (geometric arithmetic) used data, estimated means numerator denominator dimorphism ratio every method calculates . sex-specific male female means case actual dimorphism. Also reported information specific multivariate analyses addressed later. Now let’s take look various methods estimating dimorphism, starting grouping methods. methods estimate dimorphism absence information sex specimen splitting sample two sub-samples larger smaller specimens. also return estimate dimorphism ratio values. Notice \"MMR\" reports numerator denominator mean. three methods split sample larger smaller measurements calculate ratio. \"MMR\" , \"BDI\" \"ERM\" multiple times, cases full set numerators denominators stored resulting object (save memory). Now finite mixture model methods. Unlike grouping methods, models assign individual specimens groups, rather use collectively estimate properties underlying distributions sampled . \"MoM\" estimates difference means two lognormal distributions rather means , numerator denominator values calculated. \"FMA\" \"BFM\" estimate population means, estimates provided, \"BFM\" includes additional information finite mixture model. finally, variance-based methods. Unlike methods, provide direct estimates dimorphism ratios. Instead, estimates proportional size variation sample. Methods based coefficient variation can opt apply sample size correction factor Sokal Braumann (1980) specifying ncorrection = TRUE. values \"CV\" estimates unitless, expressing standard deviation sample percentage arithmetic mean sample. Note mean function \"CV\" always arithmetic mean, regardless user-specified value center. analogous method using geometric mean \"sdlog\", discussed . sex designation data available specimens, method \"CVsex\" can used. Rather using mean entire data set calculation standard deviation CV, mean sex-specific means used instead. counteracts bias introduced uneven sex ratios /different variances sex-specific distributions. addition \"CV\", alternative (arguably better - see Gordon, 2025a) method measuring relative variability calculate standard deviation logged data (\"sdlog\"), also measure proportional dispersion sample. Like \"CV\" \"CVsex\", also version approach uses mean sex-specific means rather overall mean calculating standard deviation (\"sdlogsex\"). values estimates units difference logged original data. According log rules, log()−log(b)=log(/b)log()-log(b)=log(/b), units equivalent units logarithm ratios, unitless. standard deviation logged data essentially average proportional deviation observations around geometric mean sample.
