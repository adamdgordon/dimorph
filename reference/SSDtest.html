<dl><dt id="arg-fossil">fossil<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-fossil"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A list of matrices or data frames of measurements from fossil sample(s) (or other test samples) to be
compared in a series of pairwise resampling tests, with rows corresponding to individual specimens and
columns corresponding to size variables.  Sex data should not be included.  Some data can be missing.
When a single fossil sample is present, by default null distributions of resampled values from comparative data sets
will be compared to a single point estimate generated for the fossil sample (one point estimate per estimation
method).  <code>fossil</code> may be <code>NULL</code>, in which case all samples should be provided in <code>comp</code>, and all
samples will be resampled.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-comp">comp<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-comp"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A list of matrices or data frames of measurements from comparative sample(s) to be
compared in a series of pairwise resampling tests, with rows corresponding to individual specimens and
columns corresponding to size variables.  Sex data should not be included.  All data sets must be complete
for all measurements.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-fossilsex">fossilsex<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-fossilsex"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A list of vectors indicating sex for the individuals in each of the samples in <code>fossil</code>.
Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-compsex">compsex<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-compsex"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A list of vectors indicating sex for the individuals in each of the samples in <code>comp</code>.
Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-methsuni">methsUni<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-methsuni"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character vector specifying the univariate method(s) used to calculate or estimate dimorphism.
See <code><a href="dimorph.html">dimorph</a></code> for options.  Defaults to <code>c("MMR", "BDI")</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-methsmulti">methsMulti<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-methsmulti"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character vector specifying the multivariate method(s) used to
calculate or estimate dimorphism.  Note that regardless of the value of this argument,
multivariate estimation procedures will only be carried out if <code>fossil</code> and <code>comp</code> are multivariate
datasets.  See <code><a href="dimorph.html">dimorph</a></code> for options.  Defaults to <code>"GMM"</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-replace">replace<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-replace"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar specifying whether to sample from comparative datasets with replacement or not.
Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-rebootstrap">rebootstrap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-rebootstrap"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar specifying whether to add an additional step after initial resampling in
which resampled addresses for both comparative and fossil datasets are bootstrapped (i.e., sampled with
replacement to an equal sample sizes as the initial set of resampled addresses).  This procedure implements
the highly conservative "resampled extinct distribution method" of Gordon et al. (2008). Defaults to
<code>FALSE</code>.  Warning: setting <code>rebootstrap</code> to <code>TRUE</code> will drastically reduce power!</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-fullsamplesboot">fullsamplesboot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-fullsamplesboot"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar.  If all samples are complete (no missing data) and <code>fullsamplesboot</code> is
set to <code>TRUE</code>, rather than downsampling to the minimum sample in <code>fossil</code>, all samples in <code>fossil</code> are
and <code>comp</code> are bootstrapped (i.e., sampled with replacement at their full sample size).  Defaults to
<code>FALSE</code>.  Note that for univariate analyses, <code>NA</code>s are removed by default so all datasets (including
fossils) are considered complete.  Therefore setting <code>fullsamplesboot</code> to <code>TRUE</code> for univariate analyses
with fossils will bootstrap the fossil dataset rather than generating a single point estimate from the fossil dataset.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-nresamp">nResamp<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-nresamp"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Integer specifying the number of resampling iterations
if Monte Carlo sampling is used.  Defaults to <code>1,000</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-exactcomp">exactcomp<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-exactcomp"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar specifying for samples in <code>comp</code> whether to sample all possible unique
combinations of resampled datasets for the minimum data structure present in <code>fossil</code>.
If set to <code>FALSE</code>, or if set to <code>TRUE</code> and the number of unique combinations exceeds <code>limit</code>,
then Monte Carlo sampling is used instead.  Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-exactfossil">exactfossil<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-exactfossil"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar specifying for samples in <code>fossil</code> whether to sample all
possible unique combinations of resampled datasets for the minimum data structure present in <code>fossil</code>.
If set to <code>FALSE</code>, or if set to <code>TRUE</code> and the number of unique combinations exceeds <code>limit</code>,
then Monte Carlo sampling is used instead.  Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-limit">limit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-limit"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Integer setting the upper limit on the number of unique combinations allowable
for exact resampling.  If exact resampling would produce more resampled datasets than this number,
Monte Carlo resampling is used instead.  Defaults to <code>50,000</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-center">center<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-center"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character string specifying the method used to calculate a mean, either <code>"geomean"</code>
(default) which uses the geometric mean, or <code>"mean"</code> which uses the arithmetic mean.  More broadly,
<code>"geomean"</code> indicates analyses are conducted in logarithmic data space and <code>"mean"</code> indicates
analyses are conducted in raw data space.  Some methods can only be applied in one domain or the other:
<code>"CV"</code> and <code>"CVsex"</code> are always calculated in raw data space and <code>center</code> will be set to
<code>"mean"</code> for these methods regardless of the value set by the user; <code>"MoM"</code>, <code>"sdlog"</code>,
and <code>"sdlogsex"</code> are always calculated in logarithmic data space and <code>center</code> will be set to
<code>"geomean"</code> for these methods regardless of the value set by the user.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sex-female">sex.female<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sex-female"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An integer scalar (1 or 2) specifying which level of <code>sex</code>
corresponds to female.  Ignored if <code>sex</code> is <code>NULL</code>.  Defaults to 1.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-na-rm">na.rm<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-na-rm"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A logical scalar indicating whether <code>NA</code> values should be stripped before
the computation proceeds in univariate analyses.  Not relevant for multivariate analyses.  Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-ncorrection">ncorrection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-ncorrection"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A logical scalar indicating whether to apply Sokal and Braumann's (1980)
size correction factor to CV estimates.  Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-matchvars">matchvars<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-matchvars"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Logical scalar specifying whether to compare the shared set of variable names in
<code>comp</code> and <code>fossil</code> to the variable names in <code>struc</code> and pare them all down to the
set of shared variables. If <code>FALSE</code> and variable names differ then an error will be returned.
Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-datastruc">datastruc<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-datastruc"></a></dt>
<dd><p>If multivariate data are used, this is a character string specifiying whether to
incorporate the missing data structure
into dimorphism estimates (<code>"missing"</code>), whether to downsample to the missing data sample size but
keep all metric data for the comparative sample (<code>"complete"</code>), or to perform both types of
resampling separately (<code>"both"</code>).  Ignored if only univariate data are provided or if all datasets
are complete. Defaults to <code>NULL</code>, which reverts to <code>"missing"</code> if some datasets are incomplete.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-templatevar">templatevar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-templatevar"></a></dt>
<dd><p>A character object or integer value specifying the name or column number
of the variable in <code>fossil</code> and <code>comp</code> to be estimated using the template method.  Ignored
if template method is not used.  Defaults to <code>NULL</code>.</p></dd>
